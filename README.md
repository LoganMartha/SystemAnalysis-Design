# SystemAnalysis-Design
In this course, we learned about the prep process of a system.  The documents in this repository are based off the project we worked on during the class.  We had a mock system, DriverPass, and were to plan out the major points of it.

- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  For this system, DriverPass, the customer was a business who specializes in prepping teens for their driving exams.  They realized that there was a lack of opportunity for teens to really practice their skills, so they came up with this business.  They wanted a     scheduling system to allow their students to purchase and schedule their appointments.
- What did you do particularly well?
  I thought, within this project, I did a good job creating UML diagrams. (seen in system document design document) I thought I was thorough and clear in what I was trying to get across in the diagrams.
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  One thing I think I could improve on is really understanding ALL of the requirements needed in order to make the system run.  Since these things can go so in depth, I did not spend as much times as I should have researched and really understanding what exactly is needed for these system to run.  I was a little vague.
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I thought I did a great job in making sure everything the user needs is implemented.  In the end of it all, who is going to be using the system? THE USER!  So making sure that you are aligning the user needs within the system is very important.
- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I think creating UML diagrams is a great way to really map out a software.  Being able to see how a system works without technical jargon and coding really allows for you to see it clearly and easily understand.  I will definitely use UML diagrams in the future for projects.
